These are a few studies of assembly language made using "coco", a java program that can both disassemble python codes into assembly, and interpret assembly codes as if it was python

To test any file you need to excecute the coco script with the file as an argument:
	./coco file

Every assembly file has a python code equivalent with the same name. Explanation about each code is also commented in the python codes.

In this repository there are no files of disassembled codes originally made in python, rather, the exercises were written in assembly and the python equivalents were written afterwords for clarification
